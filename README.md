# Project: Image-to-Caption Generator using Generative AI
This project demonstrates a simple pipeline to load, process, and analyze an image using a deep learning model. It uses Python and popular libraries like `Pillow` for image handling and can be extended to image classification, labeling, or other computer vision tasks.

## 🖼️ What it Does

- Loads an image (`random1.jpg`)
- Converts it to RGB
- Passes it to a processing pipeline (e.g., a model for predictions or labeling)
- Outputs results (e.g., label, name, or classification)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- (Optional) Transformers or other image models from Hugging Face
- OS module for path handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project_Image-to-Caption Generator using Generative AI.git
cd project_giving_names


### 2. Install Requirements
pip install Pillow
# If using Hugging Face model:
# pip install transformers



### 3. Run the Demo
python demo.py


### ⚠️ Troubleshooting
If you see a FileNotFoundError, make sure:

The image random1.jpg exists in the correct folder

The path to the image is correct in demo.py
